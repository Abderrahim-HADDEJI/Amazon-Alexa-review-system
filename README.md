Predict feedback according to the Alexa review system.


A review system is basically a system whereby a customer uses something and comments on a particular project or product.
We will determine whether the product feedback is positive or negative by analyzing its examination.

As part of this project, we will conduct exploratory data analysis and audit our data. To know if other data are also related to providing comments or only the text that is given by the user who sees this part. And then verify whether another piece is needed with the comments as well.

After that, we will build our model to predict the feedback that we will create for the review committee that will give us the result.
